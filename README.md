# Space-Runner
## Instructions
### Welcome
Welcome to our project: Space-Runner. We are 6 engineering Students at the ZHAW. First you will get an instruction on how to set-up the project, How to Play, testing and the project outlines and how far we've progressed.

### Set-Up
Make sure Java 11 or higher is installed on your system.

Clone the project to a local folder and opn it with an IDE (gradle preinstalled).
Start it by entering "gradle run" in the terminal.

If you want to test the beta of the game, get the [version 1.0 beta release](https://github.zhaw.ch/islermic/PM3-HS20-IT19a_WIN-Team03/releases).
Extract the zip file and run the jar by double clicking or opening the command prompt and start it by using the command: "java -jar SpaceRunner.jar"

### How To Play
First you need to start the programm. Then you are greeted by the Main Screen where you can choose between Start, Shop and Settings. You can also find help by clicking on the Help button.

![help screen](https://github.zhaw.ch/islermic/PM3-HS20-IT19a_WIN-Team03/blob/master/instruction_resources/help_screen.gif)

#### Start
After pressing Start you need to Press **SPACE** to start the Run. 

![game start](https://github.zhaw.ch/islermic/PM3-HS20-IT19a_WIN-Team03/blob/master/instruction_resources/game_start.gif)

When in Game you can dodge the Obstacles or Collect the Coins / PowerUps with the :arrow_up: or :arrow_down: Buttons. After you collide with an Obstacle you see the Game Over Screen where you can decide between Menu and Restart. Menu gets you back to the Main Screen. Restart restarts the Game.

#### Shop

![go to shop](https://github.zhaw.ch/islermic/PM3-HS20-IT19a_WIN-Team03/blob/master/instruction_resources/shop.gif)

Here you can buy and manage Upgrades or Player models
* Upgrades
  * 1.5x PowerUp Chance (The chance that PowerUp will appear is increased)
  * Double duration of Coin PowerUp (Increases the duration of Coin PowerUp from 10 to 20 seconds)

* If you have enough coins to buy an item you can click on the "buy" button next to the item. Another small window will appear that ask you asking you if you really want to buy this item. So you can purchase  or cancel the item. It works the same for the upgrades and the playermodel. <br/>
![buy upgrade](https://github.zhaw.ch/islermic/PM3-HS20-IT19a_WIN-Team03/blob/master/instruction_resources/shop_upgarde_buy.gif) <br/>

* This warning is displayed if you do not have enough coins to buy something in the store. It also indicates how many coins you are missing to buy this item.<br/>
![not enough coins](https://github.zhaw.ch/islermic/PM3-HS20-IT19a_WIN-Team03/blob/master/instruction_resources/shop_not_enough_coins.PNG) <br/>

* Player model
  * Ship Skin 1
  * Ship Skin 2 
  
* If you have bought a skin, you can activate and deactivate it, so you can also switch between skins. For the upgrades the activation works exactly the same. <br/>

#### Settings
If you click on the "SETTINGS" button, you will land here. In the settings you can set the player name or change the sound and the framerate. <br/>
![go to settings](https://github.zhaw.ch/islermic/PM3-HS20-IT19a_WIN-Team03/blob/master/instruction_resources/settings.gif) <br/>

* You can change the player name by overwriting it. <br/>

* You can adjust the sound and framerate by moving the button. <br/>

## Project Outlines
### Brief Summary
The goal of the Project is to create a Endless Sidescroller similar to Jetpack Joyride or Templerun. 

## Pull Request
Pull requests are merged and discussed together on a voice chat (e.g. Discord/Teams). Feedback is directly provided per voice.

## Testing
We tested what we could but since it's a Game most of the testing couldn't be done with JUnit.
